# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end
end

rabbit = Pet.new("Jabby")
rabbit.name("Chokola")
```

What will `rabbit.name("Chokola")` in this example return?

## Correct

```rb
ArgumentError
```

> Perfect! The `name` method wasn't expecting any arguments, so it produced an
> error.

## Incorrect

```rb
"Chokola"
```

> Is `name` a getter or a setter? What happens when you run the code? Why?

## Incorrect

```rb
"Jabby"
```

> A lot of people would expect it to return "Jabby", but it doesn't. What
> happens when you run this code? Why?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
