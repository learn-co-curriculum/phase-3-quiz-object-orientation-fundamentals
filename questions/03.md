# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```ruby
class Pet:
  def __init__ (self, name):
    self.name = name def print_name(self, name): print(self.name)

dog = Petdog.print_name()
```

`Pet `in this example will instantiate a new instance of the `Pet` class and
print\_name() will print nothing.&nbsp;

## Correct

False

> Correct! We need to provide a name when instantiating an instance of the `Pet`
> class because that's what `initialize` expects. We'll get an TypeError when we
> try to use the name attribute.

## Incorrect

True

> This is a bit of a tough question. Take a look at the&nbsp; ` __init__ ` function
> and then the last line of code. What do you notice?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
