# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end
end

dog = Pet.new
```

`Pet.new` in this example will instantiate a new instance of the `Pet` class.

## Correct

False

> Correct! We need to provide a name when instantiating an instance of the `Pet`
> class because that's what `initialize` expects. We'll get an `ArgumentError`
> when running this code.

## Incorrect

True

> This is a bit of a tough question. Take a look at `initialize` and then the
> last line of code. What do you notice?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
