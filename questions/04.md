# Getter Methods

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end
end

rabbit = Pet.new("Jabby")
rabbit.name
```

`rabbit.name` in this example will output `"Jabby"`.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The `name` method will output the value stored in `@name`, which was set
> to `"Jabby"` when this pet was initialized.

## Incorrect

False

> What happens when you run the code? How and why does that differ from what you
> expected? Which methods are available in `Pet` and what do they do?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
