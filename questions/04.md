# Getter Methods

Consider the following code:

```
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end
end
```

```
rabbit = Pet.new("Jabby")
rabbit.name
```

`rabbit.name`&nbsp;in this example will return&nbsp;`"Jabby"`.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
