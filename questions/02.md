# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```
class Pet
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

dog = Pet.new("Harpo")
```

In the example above,&nbsp;`Pet.new("Harpo")`&nbsp;will instantiate a new
instance of the&nbsp;`Pet`&nbsp;class.

## Correct

True

> Yes! The class has been declared correctly, so a new instance will be returned
> when the code is run.

## Incorrect

False

> Run the code. Why did you think a new instance of `Pet` would not be created?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
