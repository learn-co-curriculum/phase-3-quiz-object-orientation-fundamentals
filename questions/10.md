# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```source
class Pet
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

```source
buddy = Pet.new("Buddy")
```

What will&nbsp;`buddy.name`&nbsp;in this example output?

## Correct

```
"Buddy"
```

> Correct! The value of `name` was set when the object was initialized. Because of
> the `attr_accessor` macro, we can read and write to the `name` instance
> variable.

## Incorrect

```
ArgumentError
```

> Which line do you think will produce an error? What happens when you run the
> code? Why?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
