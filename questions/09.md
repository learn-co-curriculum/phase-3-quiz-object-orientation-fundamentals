# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Pet
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

buddy = Pet.new("Buddy")
buddy.name = "Chappie"
```

Considering the code above, what will `buddy.name` output?

## Correct

```rb
"Chappie"
```

> Exactly! The name was reassigned on the last line of the code.

## Incorrect

```rb
"Buddy"
```

> Not quite. Check out the last two lines of code. What's happening on each of
> those lines?

## Incorrect

```rb
ArgumentError
```

> Which line do you think will produce an error? What happens instead when you run
> the code? Why does that happen?

## Incorrect

I don't know
