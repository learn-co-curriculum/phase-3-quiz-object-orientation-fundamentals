# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```source
class Pet
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :name
  
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

```source
buddy = Pet.new("Buddy")
buddy.name = "Chappie"
```

Considering the code above, what will&nbsp;`buddy.name`&nbsp;output?

## Correct

```
"Chappie"
```

> Exactly! The name was reassigned on the last line of the code.

## Incorrect

```
"Buddy"
```

> Not quite. Check out the last two lines of code. What's happening on each of
> those lines?

## Incorrect

```
ArgumentError
```

> Which line do you think will produce an error? What happens instead when you run
> the code? Why does that happen?

## Incorrect

I don't know
