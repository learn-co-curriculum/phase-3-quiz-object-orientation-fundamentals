# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```ruby
class Pet:

  def __init__ (self, name):
    self.name = name

buddy = Pet("Buddy")
buddy.name = "Chappie"print(buddy.name)
```

Considering the code above, what will `buddy.name` output?

## Correct

```ruby
"Chappie"
```

> Exactly! The name was reassigned on the last line of the code.

## Incorrect

```ruby
"Buddy"
```

> Not quite. Check out the last two lines of code. What's happening on each of
> those lines?

## Incorrect

```ruby
TypeError
```

> Which line do you think will produce an error? What happens instead when you run
> the code? Why does that happen?

## Incorrect

I don't know
